Id,Proposition,Comments
2,every phenomenal property is relevant to causally explaining some caused event with physical properties (phenomenal efficacy),"You can leave the id column blank, it's there for reference in case nec"
3,every property relevant to causally explaining caused events with physical properties is itself fully grounded in physical properties (physical non-overdetermination),
4,every truth about consciousness is a truth about phenomenal properties (consciousness-phenomenality identity),
5,every truth about consciousness is fully grounded in truths about physical properties (physicalism about consciousness),
6,there is a phenomenal property F such that it is not the case that F is relevant to causally explaining any caused event (phenomenal dead ends),
7,there is a phenomenal property F such that F is relevant to causally explaining some caused event with purely non-physical properties,
8,there are events with purely non-physical properties,
9,any world which is a physical duplicate of the actual world w is a duplicate of w simpliciter (supervenience physicalism),
10,"for every actual particular x (event, object, process, etc), there is some physical particular y such that x is identical to y (token physicalism)",
11,"for every actually instantiated property F, there is some physical property G such that F is identical to G (type physicalism)",
12,every property instantiated is either identical to a physical property or fully grounded in a physical property (grounding physicalism),
13,every caused event with physical properties has a full causal explanation in purely physical terms (causal completeness of physics),
14,there is a caused event with physical properties that has no full causal explanation,
15,there is a caused event with physical properties such that it has a full causal explanation and any full causal explanation of it is in partially non-physical terms,
16,there is a caused event with physical properties that has a full causal explanation in purely non-physical terms,
17,there is a caused event with physical properties that has no full explanation,
18,there is a caused event with physical properties such that it has a full explanation and any full explanation of it is in partially non-causal terms,
19,every event has a full explanation (principle of sufficient reason),
20,there are non-causal explanations,
21,the conjunction of all of the truths about microphysical properties and the negation of some truth about phenomenal properties is conceivable (conceivability of zombies),
22,"if p is conceivable, then p is metaphysically possible (conceivability principle)",
23,every event is distinct,
24,"it is conceivable that for every distinct event e beginning at time t, there are two worlds w1 and w2 which are identical up until t where, in w1, e occurs, while in w2, e does not occur (separability principle)",
25,every causal relation is a metaphysically necessary relation (causal determinism),
26,there are causal relations,
27,every explanation is a metaphysically necessary relation,
28,there are explanations,
